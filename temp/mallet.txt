      Default is false
    --prefix-code 'JAVA CODE'
      Java code you want run before any other interpreted code.  Note that the text is interpreted without modification, so unlike some other Java code options, you need to include any necessary 'new's when creating objects.

       on that data file, for example for testing and production use.
       That previous file is *rewritten* to include any newly observed features,

       unseen features in the new file, the alphabet for the new file
       will be a super-set of the alphabet in the original file.
